<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

I'm working on Ubuntu 20.04

### Prerequisites

* nodejs
  
  To get this version, you can use the apt package manager. Refresh your local package index first by typing:
  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  ```
  Then install Node.js:
  ```sh
  sudo apt install nodejs
  ```
  Check that the install was successful by querying node for its version number:
  ```sh
  node -v
  ```
* **npm**
  
  If the package in the repositories suits your needs, this is all you need to do to get set up with Node.js. In most cases, youâ€™ll also want to also install npm, the   Node.js package manager. You can do this by installing the npm package with apt:
   ```sh
  sudo apt install npm
  ```
* **Create an AWS Account, if you don't already have one**

* **AWS CLI**

  To update or install the AWS CLI on your machine, you can refer to this amazing AWS documentation:
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html
  
  After install the AWS CLI on your machine, open the cmd and type aws. If you get something like this, then you are good to go:
  ```sh
  C:\Users\prith>aws                                                                                                                                                     usage: aws [options] <command> <subcommand> [<subcommand> ...] [parameters]                                             
  To see help text, you can run:
  aws help
  aws <command> help
  aws <command> <subcommand> help
  aws: error: the following arguments are required: command 
  ```
  
* **Serverless framework**

  Serverless framework comes with a pretty amaizing cmd. To install it, you can refer to this serverless framework documentation. I've used npm to install it, as it is   really easy.
  https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started
  
* **Configure the AWS CLI**

  Currently AWS or serverless don't know who you are. So you need to do the following steps:
  * Head over to your AWS developer console, and serach for the service IAM. This service handles permissions and users in AWS
  * Head over to **Users** from the left panel
  * Now you need to create a new user. Because it is not recommented to user your root AWS account. 
    * Give your new user the Programmatic access and AWS Management Console access.
    * Create a password for this new user
    * Attach Policies: You can give the AdmistratorAccess to your user, but in production built its recommended to give users permission to that many services that           they require.
    * After creating the user, you will get an Access key ID and Secret access key. You will need those to configure the AWS CLI.
    * Head over to your cmd and type **aws configure**, and give the Access key ID and Secret access key, along with the aws region and serverless.yaml file format.
      ```sh
      C:\Users\prith>aws configure
      AWS Access Key ID [****************YSHX]: <ACCESS KEY ID>
      AWS Secret Access Key [****************DXmb]: <SECRET ACCESS KEY>
      Default region name [us-east-1]: <REGION>
      Default output format [yaml]: <FORMAT OF YOUR serverless.yml file. Give yaml>
      ```
    * Now log out from your AWS developer console and sing-in with the new username and password that you just created
